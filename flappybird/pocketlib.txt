Based on Miko Hoshina & Martin Korth work.

How to compile:
-Install devkitarm from devkitpro
-Modify the Makefile to change your program name
-Modify the makedata.bat to change your program name and icon
-Change the path in "compil.bat" to match where you installed devkitpro and your make tool.
-Start "compil.bat"

Details:
"pocketlib.h" is the Lib and must be included at first in your C file.
I choose to make a unique .h file for simplicity.

"header.S" is the assembly part with the Memory Card header description.
This file include:
-"data\title.txt" which contains the Memory Card title, see "makedata.bat" and "ascii2jis" tool.
-"data\psicon.bin" which is the MemoryCard icon made from data\icon.tim, see "makedata.bat" and "tim2mcicon" tool.
-"data\icon.bin" which is the PocketStation icon made from data\icon.bmp, see "makedata.bat" and "bmp2ps1b" tool.
-"data.s" which can include your binary data (use .globl / .incbin)

Use my tool "bmp2ps1b" to convert your graphic data (32xN 1bit BMP file)

You can emulate your program in the NO$GBA emulator (which include a PocketStation emulator since the 2.7 version)

Or you can upload it on your PocketStation using my Playstation To PocketStation Transfer Tool: (or a PC to MemoryCard reader)
